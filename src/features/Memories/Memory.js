      I still remember the first time I tried to talk to you and since I had no
      idea on how to talk to a girl I don't know, Idk why I taught like that but
      my head started thinking of complex numbers and at that moment you just
      ignored me like I was nothing and you said that I'm just trying to flex
      with my knowledge 🤓 and maybe you was right 🤣🤣🤣🤣, and after that we
      talked for two days on the transport I was just asking about school and
      other things that are related to studies and the truth is that I was
      looking at you 🥹❤️ and somehow I felt different when I talk to you and
      even though it was hurting my neck but I talked to you the next day and
      then I gave you my number ✨️❤️ and believe me I was waiting just for your
      text 🤣🤣❤️ and after you finally showed up you asked me about animals and
      we found that we have somethings in common and we kept talking for too
      long ✨️ and the next day if I remember clearly I texted you in the
      morning so early 🤣🤣🤣🤣 and at that moment I knew you are a sleepy girl
      🫂❤️ and we just kept discovering each other and we I asked you to play a
      three wishes game because sometimes I act childish and all I want is just
      to play and enjoy the moment and you accepted 🥹🤎 and the next day I
      visited my grandma and I remember that night we kept talking until like
      4AM and at that night after we said good night 😴 I was so happy so I knew
      there is some emotions in me towards you and the next day I started to
      feel things coming from you so I said it🫂🫂 and I got rejected and I
      started to think what should I do 🤔🤔 but since I don't know how to act
      with girls I said I don't care if I got rejected again I'm gonna try again
      tomorrow and everyday until she stops talking to me or just accept me 🥹❤️
      and I'm glad I decided like that and I didn't choose to follow a man's ego
      and since that day me and you are together for 125 days 🥹❤️🫂 and I hope
      we keep the days counting until we die 🥺❤️🫂.
